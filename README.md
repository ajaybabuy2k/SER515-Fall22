## Design Patterns Assignment


How to run the project :-

First run the run.java to start the program give select accordingly.

1 : - Implementing the facade design pattern and implementing the login.

The program asks the user to enter the credentils.

The user inputs the credentils from the provided files then it proceeds to the next step

else the program quits when the user is unauthenticated.

if the credentils are correct then the user goes to next step.

Conclusion :- Implemented using the facade design pattern.


2 :- Displaying the product menu items

The program displays all the items in the product menu and user product items.

It helps the user to see all the list of items in the menu's so user can select according as per the he wants.

I have used the iterator design pattern to display all the product menu items and userproduct items to the user so user can see all the popular items as many requested or in demand.


3 :- Display the product menu items as per the category

The program displays the items as per the user requirement as the program takes input from user either he wants the produce products or meat products.

Implemented the bridge design pattern here .

it helps to filter products as per the category to display specfic category items.

So it asks the user for input either meat or product to display specfic input items.

Implemented the factory design pattern here and displayed as per the requirement.

4. Next Step

The program asks the user to quit for ordering an items to display the most people ordered item when they select a particular item. or want to continue the previous steps

If the user selects yes then it quits else it continues all the previous steps.


5. Displaying the demand item

After quitting from the above steps then it asks the user for the order name

Implemented the visitor design pattern in the trading class. 

On input based on that input it displays the no of people ordered that particular ordername and shows the count of the people ordered to display the how much popular the item was.
